### About
This repo contains all (working and tested) dotfiles for my Linux setups.

### Branches
This is the master branch and its contents should be minimum. Master contains only files that should work on any OS and window manager/DE. Currently the only config I'm planning to make universal is vim. Dotfiles for each setup are provided in other branches. Different branches are never meant to be merged - they're just file containers. 

Dotfiles can be copied assuming that this repository is the home directory. Screenshots, workflows, instructions, and dependancy information are also provided.
