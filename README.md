#### :large_orange_diamond: About
This repo contains all (working and tested) dotfiles for my Linux setups.

#### :large_orange_diamond: Branches
* This is the master branch and its contents should be minimum. Master contains only files that should work on any OS and window manager/DE. Currently the only config I'm planning to make universal is vim. 
* Dotfiles for each setup are provided in other branches. Different branches are never meant to be merged - they're just file containers. 
* Main branch is **arch-i3-gaps** - the one that contains the files for my personal computer. The rest are just for virtual machines.
* Dotfiles can be copied assuming that this repository is the home directory. Screenshots, workflows, instructions, and dependancy information are also provided.
